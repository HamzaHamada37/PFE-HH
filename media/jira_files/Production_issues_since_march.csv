the client instructions (Breakdown Instruction) are not processed correctly by the system in the two INTR events below. 

INTR00163407 - AT0000A2XML 

Client 236500 => 17.420.000 

Breakdown Instruction => 17.430.000 

The instruction exceeds the actual client holding, so it should not be executed. 

However, the instruction has been executed, although this is not visible under 'Client Entitlement'. 



We have the same problem with ISIN AT0000A2XMN6 

INTR00163408 - AT0000A2XMN6 

Client 236500 => 40.941.000 

Breakdown Instruction => 40.952.000 

The instruction exceeds the actual client holding, so it should not be executed. 



Please check this urgently\!
